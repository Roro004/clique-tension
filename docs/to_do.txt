To do
---
Tecnicial
convery the force model to a dygraph
make signage influence acceleration
Add network flow temp as acceleration?


Clustering based on signage
be able to randomly add signage , 1, -1, 0 for non edge
Threshold based on signage, overall dyad strength aggegration
from dyad to maximal clique

network flow? cutting along 2 - edges

Threshold
Threshold based on symetry
Threshold based on signage
threshold models for dyad


---
add structural balence score, add updating balence
add plot and spectral embedding to bias force





Model
variables
- edge density and pattern
- size of network
- type of network
- signage disterbutions +1, -1, 0




xx
allow the addition of weight to edges to represent flow
field disterbution based on network density and signage
xx

Threshold
Threshold based on symetry
Threshold based on signage
threshold models for dyad

dyad expansion - maxiaml cliques, further
different clustering based on signage

--
Visuval
Add visuval to main model
Colour edges and nodes accoding to clusters - - Draw a clique as a cluster


Model
variables
- edge density and pattern
- size of network
- type of network
- signage disterbutions +1, -1, 0



identify
- strength of each edge
-

visuval
- field distabution based on signage
-

force
- edges with less force end up closer togeather
