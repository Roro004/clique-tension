To do
---
Tecnicial
convery the foce model to a dygraph
allow the addition of weight to edges to represent flow
field disterbution based on network density and signage

----
Threshold
Threshold based on symetry
Threshold based on signage
threshold models for dyad

dyad expansion - maxiaml cliques, further
different clustering based on signage

--
Visuval
Add visuval to main model
Colour edges and nodes accoding to clusters - - Draw a clique as a cluster


Model
variables
- edge density and pattern
- size of network
- signage disterbutions
- weight disterbutions


identify
- strength of each edge
-

visuval
- field distabution based on signage
-

force
- edges with less force end up closer togeather
